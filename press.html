          <p><img src="house1.jpg">“I’ve noticed that buildings in Austin that were built before air-conditioning tend to be remarkable things,” he says. “People were very creative back then to make a space comfortable, so instead of installing a standard ducted-forced air system, we’re including individual A/C units and large fans to circulate the air. We’re also building deep canopies on the east and west sides of the building to help block out the sun at certain times of the day. You get an organic effect that seems natural and connected to the local climate and nature.” - Arthur Andersson, FAIA

          <p>“We look forward to undertaking this major redevelopment and delivering a product that competes with new Class A office product,” said Brian Leslie, Prescott Group’s managing director. “This location is superb and certain other classic features simply can’t be replicated today, like a massive oak tree that will become a new focal point and gathering place. The concept behind our renovation is to save the best of what exists and pair it with the best of what’s current in terms of architecture, design and appealing amenities.” “When all is said and done, we will have created something that respects the original design … while providing downtown with a new structure with timeless appeal,” Andersson-Wise principal Arthur Andersson said.
